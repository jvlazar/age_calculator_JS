# Age Calculator App



## Project Information
**Project Title:** Age Calculator  
**Project Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript(Vanilla)  
**Project Referenced From:** [Frontend Mentor - Age Calculator](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/age-calculator-app-dF9DFFpj-Q)  
  
**Project Description:**   
Mini challenge from Frontend Mentor on creating an age calculator to practice HTML, CSS, and JS.


To use, input your birthday in days, months, and year, and hit the button.

Results will display user's age as of today.

  
## Project Specifics
**Things I Learned**  
- Basic principles of JavaScript (i.e. functions, variables, etc)  
- Learning the difference between the different "display" properties (i.e. flex vs. block)  
- Adding HTML elements depending on certain conditions using JavaScript  
- Changing HTML element properties with CSS through JavaScript  
- How to add background images to buttons and work with .svg files


**Things I Enjoyed**
- Learning basic JavasScript syntax and functionality  
- Trying to get the visual look of the calculator to be as close to the original as possible


**Things I'd Do Differently**  
- Before refactoring, I overcomplicated the calculations. Doing this again, I would first take a step back to properly thing over the math behind these calculations. Although they're technically simple, delving straight into it without a plan resulted in overthinking the problem and constantly refactoring the code 

**Challenges That Were Faced**  
- Changing HTML elements based on certain conditions using JavaScript  
- Figuring out the cleanest way to write code to calculate the values (and having to rewrite code multiple times as a result)
